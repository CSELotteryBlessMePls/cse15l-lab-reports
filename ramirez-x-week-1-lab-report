To install VSCode, go to [the VSCode Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) . Click on the big blue button to download and run the installer to install.

To connect to the lab computers remotely, make sure that open ssh is installed on your windows device by going to settings > searching for "optional features" > checking from the dropdown list that both the "OpenSSH Client" and "OpenSSH Server" are installed.
Then, in VSCode, open a new terminal and type in "ssh cs15lfa22**@ieng6.ucsd.edu" where the two asterisks are replaced with the two characters associated with your CSE 15L account (can be found at [this site](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php))
You should be able to enter in your account password. I (and many other of my peers) had trouble with this.


Despite not being able to be remotely connected to the lab computers, I can still show you how to use some of the commands you will use!
